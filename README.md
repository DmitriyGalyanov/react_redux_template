# React Redux template. Improved.

**Based on [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) Redux [Template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux)**

## Additionally includes following packages
- [@craco/craco](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco)
- [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)
- [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)

## Additionally includes following
- directories structure
- craco.config.js with default paths aliases
- App.css => App.scss
- colors.scss
- animations.scss
- fonts

### How to use
- clone the entire repository to the root directory of your project
- run 'npm install' at the root directory of your project (you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/link) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node) installed on your machine)
- remove .gitignore files from yet empty directories
- that's it, you're ready to go

### npm scripts
Since the template is based on [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and enhanced by [craco](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco) all scripts (and other settings) can be found at those projects repositories
